% [This section of the SRS should describe the 
% general factors that affect the product and its 
% requirements.  This section does not state 
% specific requirements.  Instead, it provides a 
% background for those requirements, which are 
% defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them 
% easier to understand. Include such items as:
% - product perspective
% - product functions
% - user characteristics
% - constraints
% - assumptions and dependencies
% - requirements subsets]
