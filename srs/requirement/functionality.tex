[This section describes the functional requirements 
of the system for those requirements which are 
expressed in the natural language style. For many
applications, this may constitute the bulk of 
the SRS Package and thought should be given to 
the organization of this section. This section 
is typically organized by feature, but alternative
organization methods may also be appropriate, 
for example, organization by user or organization 
by subsystem.  Functional requirements may include 
feature sets, capabilities, and security.

Where application development tools, such as requirements 
tools, modeling tools, etc., are employed to capture the 
functionality, this section document will refer to the 
availability of that data, indicating the location and 
name of the tool that is used to capture the data.]
