[Requirements for reliability of the system should
 be specified here. Some suggestions follow:

- Availability—specify the percentage of time 
  available ( xx.xx\%), hours of use, maintenance 
  access, degraded mode operations, etc.

- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) — this is 
  usually specified in hours, but it could also 
  be specified in terms of days, months or years.

- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)—how long is the 
  system allowed to be out of operation after it 
  has failed?

- Accuracy—specify precision (resolution) and 
  accuracy (by some known standard) that is required
  in the system’s output.

- Maximum Bugs or Defect Rate—usually expressed 
  in terms of bugs per thousand of lines of code 
  (bugs/KLOC) or bugs per function-point
  (bugs/function-point).
  
- Bugs or Defect Rate—categorized in terms of 
  minor, significant, and critical bugs: the 
  requirement(s) must define what is meant by 
  a “critical” bug; for example, complete loss 
  of data or a complete inability to use certain 
  parts of the system’s functionality.]
